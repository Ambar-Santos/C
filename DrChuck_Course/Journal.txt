Day 1 - Septembre 28th 2025 

I learned about the use of preconditions and postconditions 
to make better more secure functions. 
How you have to be flexible with input but very strict 
about the output of a function.

It has a name, design by contract. 

This was not learned in the course so far, but in a comment
section of a video, doesnt mean I didnt have this notion before
because I was taught this in my software engineering fundamentals
classes but the output thing was not hardcoded in my head to be 
completely honest.
